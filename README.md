# OverView OF The Project
In this project, a biological researcher Roza, collected demographic information of bacteria that came from volunteer's belly buttons in a microbiology labratory. she wants to get more knowledge about those bacteria that are in high demand in the beef industry. Roza is interested in bacterial species that have ability to synthesize protein that taste like beef. Roza has hypothesis that there is microorganism that can supply the best taste and she believes that can be found next to home like bacteria found in the human body.
# Purpose of the Project
Based on Roza's research so far and her believes she wants to get more information about different species of bacteria found on human body and to help her we are going to use our knowledge of HTML, JavaScript and plotly to help her to research. We created some informative and interactive charts that can help Roza to visualize data.
# Findings
After editing index.HTML and chart.js to build the required charts and display and interactive Dashboard the Webpage looks like this
